# Setup

- Convert your worlds folder into a ZIP archive.
- Pack the ZIP archive into the "worldreset" folder. You will find this folder in the server directory where the "server.properties" are located.
- Make sure that the ZIP archive has the same name as the Worlds folder and the Worlds name.
- Now restart the server.
